#INTRO:


This is a maze renderer made in python without any libraries only in-built libraries which renders in cmd

I actually took this challeange to make this without any libraries 



#Maze v3:


It generates a maze using hunt and kill method (https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/24/maze-generation-hunt-and-kill-algorithm) the maze data is stored in this file 

The size of the maze can be changed in the file 

Num=** (Must be an odd number)



#maze.txt:


it is the file in which the maze data is stored



#wall_coords.py:


It stores the coordinate data required for rendering the maze in 3d perspective



#Maze_Runner.py:


It is the actual file for rendering in the CMD it is still a prototype ;>

you might have to change the path to maze.txt (in line 288)

for this to work you have to change the following in the console:

font-size = 5

Screen_Buffer_Size :

Width = 449
Height = 141 

Window_Size :

Width = 449
Height = 141 

It still might not look good in your computer as this is still a prototype


#CONTROLS:

TRUN LEFT = a
TURN RIGHT = d
FORWARD = w
